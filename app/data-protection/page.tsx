          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mt-12 mb-4">3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
          <p>
            We process your personal data for the following purposes:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>To assess and process loan, financing, and credit applications.</li>
            <li>To verify your identity and conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks as required by law.</li>
            <li>To manage and administer your account and any active credit facilities.</li>
            <li>To communicate with you about your applications, transactions, and account status.</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            We will only process your data where we have a lawful basis to do so — including your consent, the performance of a contract, compliance with a legal obligation, or our legitimate business interests.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mt-12 mb-4">4. Data Security Measures</h2>
          <p>
            We implement robust technical and organisational security measures to protect your personal and financial data against unauthorised access, loss, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data transmitted between your device and our systems is protected using industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. Sensitive data at rest is also encrypted.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to personal data is restricted to authorised personnel only, on a strict need-to-know basis. All staff with access to personal data are bound by confidentiality obligations.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> We enforce multi-factor authentication for access to internal systems that handle personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> We conduct periodic security assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing to identify and address potential risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> We maintain a documented data breach response plan to ensure swift action in the event of a security incident.</li>
            <li><strong>Staff Training:</strong> All employees handling personal data receive regular training on data protection obligations and best practices.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While we take every reasonable precaution, no system is entirely immune to risk. We encourage you to protect your account credentials and notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorised access to your information.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mt-12 mb-4">5. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Data related to active loan or credit facilities is retained for the duration of the facility and for a minimum of seven (7) years after closure, in line with Nigerian financial regulations.</li>
            <li>KYC and identity verification records are retained for a minimum of five (5) years after the end of the business relationship.</li>

            <li>Communications and correspondence are retained for up to three (3) years unless a longer period is required by law.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When data is no longer required, it is securely deleted or anonymised in accordance with our data disposal procedures.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mt-12 mb-4">6. Sharing Your Data</h2>
          <p>
            We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data to third parties. However, we may share your information with the following categories of recipients where necessary and lawful:

          <p>
            Where the breach is likely to result in a high risk to your rights, we will also notify you directly without undue delay, providing details of the nature of the breach, the data affected, and the steps we are taking to address it.

          <p>
            Where we transfer personal data outside Nigeria — for example, to cloud service providers or technology partners — we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data to a standard equivalent to that required under Nigerian law. This may include contractual clauses, data processing agreements, or other approved transfer mechanisms.
