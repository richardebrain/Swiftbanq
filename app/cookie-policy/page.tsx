          <p>
            Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, smartphone, or tablet) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, to remember your preferences, and to provide information to website owners about how their site is being used.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies can be &quot;session cookies&quot; (which expire when you close your browser) or &quot;persistent cookies&quot; (which remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them). We may also use similar technologies such as web beacons, pixels, and local storage, which function in a comparable way.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mt-12 mb-4">2. How We Use Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            We use cookies for the following purposes:
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mt-8 mb-3">2.1 Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are essential for the website to function properly. They enable core features such as page navigation, secure access to account areas, and form submissions. Without these cookies, services you have requested cannot be provided. These cookies do not require your consent.
          </p>

          <p>
            These cookies collect information about how visitors use our website — for example, which pages are visited most often and whether users receive error messages. All information collected is aggregated and anonymous. We use this data to improve how our website works.

          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mt-8 mb-3">2.4 Marketing and Targeting Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission.
